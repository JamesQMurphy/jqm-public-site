Remember when programming used to be *fun*?

Well, okay, it's still fun.  Or should I say, it's fun once again.  But there have been times when it's not been fun.  16-hour days with ridiculous deadlines... let's not talk about that.  Instead, I'd rather talk about the good ol' days... when programming was something I did in my spare time.  When programming was something I looked forward to.  Warm summer nights.  Staying up late.  Tunes cranked on the boombox (yes I'm that old).  *Fun*.  

Well even in my 40's, I still like staying up late.  I still like cranking tunes.  And I still like programming on those warm summer nights.  It's a youthful feeling I try and recapture almost every summer, by embarking on a summer project.  A project that is...

 * Something meaningful to me
 * A chance to learn something new
 * Something to blog about

So how did I choose my project for the summer of 2018?

The first requirement -- something meaningful -- was a must.  My summer project is always part escape.  It has to be something that I want to do.  Without that in place, there'd be no motivation to do it.  But what to build?  I had a few ideas for apps that I wanted to write.  Some were more ambitious than others (like the online game).  Nothing seemed quite right. 

At least the second requirement -- learning something new -- was guaranteed to happen, no matter what I chose.  I've been doing DevOps for over five years, which is practically a *lifetime* in the software industry.  But while I was off mastering PowerShell, the rest of the programming world was learning JQuery, Bootstrap, and Angular.  Oh sure, my C# was (and still is) pretty darned good, but I never expected *JavaScript* to become *the* language.  And then just like that, it was TypeScript.  I love C#, but nobody was writing Windows desktop applications any more, and certainly nobody had used WebForms for ages (thankfully).  Yep, I was going to be schooled, one way or the other.

Oh yeah, the third requirement -- something to blog about.  Right, *this* was going to be the year that I finally started that blog!  My WordPress account was ready... I just needed a theme and a layout.  And a title.  Or wait, should I use Ghost instead?  All these decisions!  Ugh, something *else* to build.

What to build, what to build.  But then it hit me... *build a blog*.  Not just write it, *build* it.  Really... build this very blog, the very one you are reading now.  Build the blog, and blog about building it.  How deliciously meta!

Well okay... building blog software has been done before (notably, [Miniblog.Core](https://github.com/ads Kristen sent/Miniblog.Core)).  But I didn't want my site to simply be a blog... I wanted it to be something that I built from the ground-up, complete with a proper continuous-integration build process.  I wanted it to showcase some of my other programming endeavors.  I wanted it to be an integrated solution... not a site with a blog engine bolted on.

I wanted it to be *mine*.
